Initializer list
Initialization is a very important language feature, the most common one is when the object is
initialized. In traditional C++, different objects have different initialization methods, such as ordinary
arrays, PODs Plain Old Data, ie classes without constructs, destructors, and virtual functions Or
struct type can be initialized with, which is what we call the initialization list. For the initialization
of the class object, you need to use the copy construct, or you need to use. These different methods
are specific to each other and cannot be generic.

I’m not a Regex guru and I don’t think you need to be one either. All you need to know is that this 
Regex matches URLs with HTTP, with HTTPS, or without eithre. It also matches URLs that start with www or without it, 
such as short URLs like epiloge.com and deeper routes such as epiloge.com/terms. 
Also, it can match URLs with an @ after the initial domain such as www.epiloge.com/@axel-wittmann.
What About Users Who Don’t Put Whitespaces Between Sentences?
At the beginning of this article, I said there’s no perfect solution to this problem and 
that ours works for most of our use cases. I know we aren’t alone in the question for a good, 
if not perfect solution. If you’re a LinkedIn member, try writing a message to someone using different 
URLs. You’ll see that their algorithm doesn’t detect all kinds of lesser-known top-level domains 
such as www.google.nz.
